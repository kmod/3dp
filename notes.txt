temperature: 185 seems to be ok, but higher seems to work out better (better self-ahesion, looks less "log cabin"-y)
- apparetly I did up to 215 in the past; using 200 right now and it's working well

here's the last command I saved:
~/Dropbox/3dp/progs/Slic3r/slic3r.pl --load ~/Dropbox/3dp/slic3r.ini --load ~/Dropbox/3dp/slic3r_fast.ini parts_box_4.stl -o parts_box_4.gcode --fill-density=1 --top-solid-layers=0 --save parts_box_4.gcode.settings --fill-density=

can add "--first-layer-temperature=185" to force it to wait; I usually leave that out and leave the hotend on.



to do boxes faster:
--skirts=0 --external-perimeter-speed=100% --first-layer-speed=50% --solid-infill-speed=80

honeycomb fill-density of 0.2 broke down after just a few layers (layer height 0.4)

195C seemed amazingly better than 185C -- 185 didn't end up joining layers together or lines together
210C seems to work pretty well too and has fewer issues with the extruder?


1kg PLA is roughly 800cm^2 or 330m for 1.75mm

The M501 command will reload all soft settings from onboard permanent memory, and display them.
The M503 command will display current settings.
The M92 command and others, will adjust those current settings.
The M500 command will save current settings to onboard permanent memory, for next reboot.

Building firmware [wip]:
https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/68081994/printrbot/Printrbot%20Firmware.pdf

git clone git@github.com:kmod/Marlin
# Install arduino software; I've done this on 1.0.5
wget http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_118/teensyduino.64bit
chmod +x teensyduino.64bit
./teensyduino.64bit
# Choose arduino location
# choose no libraries
# install

Then to build:
launch arduino
open Marlin.pde in Marlin/Marlin
change board to Teensy++ 2.0
turn on verbose compilation
look in the /tmp/build*.tmp directory for Marlin.cpp.hex


To fix slant [wip]:
- I think it's usually a matter of tightening the respective axis
- use pliers to pull back towards the motor
- then tighten the screw.  make sure line is hooked around clockwise so that it tightens with the screw
